This repository aims to store the CAT+ ontology. The CAT+ ontology provides concepts (classes and properties) to model human and machine readable automated catalysis discovery experiment metadata. It is the result of re-using external pre-existing vocabularies such as Allotrope, schema.org and qudt, together with custom chemistry specific objects and properties. 

Swiss Cat+ is a data-driven automated infrastructure for catalysts discovery and optimization and is one of four projects directly financed by the ETH-Rat: https://swisscatplus.ch/
